## Battleship game made with React and Hooks

![scrrenshot](sreenshot.png)

This repo contains source code for the battleship game. Made with React (functional components + hooks only). Supports
the simple config, where ships can only be straight, and the one which I played when I was little, where every shape
is ok. Available to play [here](https://osvalds.github.io/battleship/)
